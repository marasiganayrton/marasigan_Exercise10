  <h1>Few of My Favourites</h1>
  <section id="section1">
    <h2 id="sports">Basketball </h2>
	<p class="paragraph">Image by: wallpaperlist </p>
    <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. My favourite sport since I started knowing how to play the sport. I started playing when I was in grade 6. My favourite player is Kobe "Bean" Bryant. Basketball can be played in different categories: one on one, two on two, three on three, four on four, and five on five. </p>

	Streetball (or street basketball) is a variation of basketball, typically played on outdoor courts and featuring significantly less formal structure and enforcement of the game's rules. As such, its format is more conducive to allowing players to publicly showcase their own individual skills. Streetball may also refer to other urban sports played on asphalt. It is particularly popular and important in New York City.
